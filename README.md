# A Brief of the Prototype:

An election is called the festival of democracy, devise methods to engage **urban & youth voters** in this festival through various means such as gamified challenges, leaderboards, referral programs, etc.

We have Tried to create a ECI-Super App. A large number of Youth today is lazy and unaware of the election machinary. We do not like to go through a number of apps and websites just to collect informations. Even though there are a lot of government run apps but people are really unaware of it. So we, have brought each and every possible information related to election process and machinary in one platform. under the slogan of "One nation-One platform for awareness"
We have introduced a gamification feautre like "leaderboards" where each wards voting turnout is measured and a leaderboard is formed. We have introduced a slogan of **"Apna booth Sbse Mazboot"**. This will motivate the Youth to go and vote so that their ward may be on top in the leaderboard.

We have introduced feedback forms which are not just feedback forms but are a source of data which common people may share **"completely as per their will"**. They can share their experience, stories, photos and videos in this portal which will create a sense of live interaction and participation. Anyone can Go through the gallery and see the photos and videos.

We have Also introduced a collaboration page, Mock Parliamentary sessions to be conducted in schools, ECI ambassador programs, Candi-chat, active feedbacks etc.
